# Python
Python for Data Science from scratch.
Hello! I am willing to make a carrer in Data Science as I have this very great interest in this field, so I am taking step by step approach to learn things and what I learn I'll be sharing it on github(https://github.com/Mahadsid) and Twitter(https://twitter.com/M_Sid_).<br>
I have a favour to ask to all who have knowledege in this field to guide me in my journey, review my study, correct me on my mistake, share their experience and show me the way how to make a carrer in tech as I am a amateur. <br>
Thank you!
I'll be uploading all the code, practice code, projects, and even advance subjects like machine learning, etc as I progress so stay tuned.
